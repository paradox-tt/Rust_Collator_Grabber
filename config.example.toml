# Collator Monitor Configuration
# ================================
# This file can be named config.toml and placed in the working directory,
# or values can be set via environment variables prefixed with COLLATOR_
# (e.g., COLLATOR_POLKADOT_COLLATOR_ADDRESS)

# Your collator account address on Polkadot-based chains (SS58 format)
polkadot_collator_address = "1YOURPOLKADOTADDRESSHERE1234567890123456789"

# Your collator account address on Kusama-based chains (SS58 format)
kusama_collator_address = "CYOURKUSAMAADDRESSHERE1234567890123456789012"

# Proxy account seed - this account signs transactions on behalf of the collator
# The proxy should be configured as NonTransfer type on-chain
# Can be a mnemonic phrase, hex seed (0x...), or derivation path (//Alice for dev)
# IMPORTANT: Keep this secret! Use environment variable COLLATOR_PROXY_SEED in production
proxy_seed = "your twelve or twenty four word mnemonic phrase goes here"

# Slack webhook URL for notifications (optional, simpler setup)
# If not set, notifications will be logged instead of sent to Slack
slack_webhook_url = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL"

# Slack Bot Token for advanced features (optional, recommended)
# Enables: message updates (disconnect duration), message deletion (on reconnect)
# Get from: https://api.slack.com/apps -> OAuth & Permissions -> Bot User OAuth Token
# Required scopes: chat:write, chat:write.public
# If set, takes priority over webhook_url
slack_bot_token = "xoxb-your-bot-token-here"

# Slack channel ID or name (required if using bot_token)
# Use channel ID (C1234567890) for private channels, name (#alerts) for public
slack_channel = "#collator-alerts"

# Slack user IDs to ping for ON-CHAIN actions (registration, bond updates, manual actions)
# These are people who can submit transactions
# Find IDs: Click user profile -> More -> Copy member ID
slack_user_ids_onchain = ["U08CUCTA3R7"]

# Slack user IDs to ping for OPS issues (block production, disconnections, collator removal)
# These are people who can check/fix infrastructure issues
slack_user_ids_ops = ["U12345ABCD", "U67890EFGH"]

# How often to check collator status in continuous mode (seconds)
check_interval_secs = 3600  # 1 hour

# Chain-specific configurations (optional)
# If not specified, default RPC endpoints will be used (LuckyFriday primary, Dwellir/Dotters fallback)
#
# You can specify multiple RPC URLs for failover:
#   rpc_urls = ["wss://primary.example.com", "wss://fallback1.example.com", "wss://fallback2.example.com"]
# Or a single URL for backwards compatibility:
#   rpc_url = "wss://single.example.com"
#
# The system will try each URL in order until one connects.
# Slack is only notified if ALL URLs fail.
#
# NOTE: BridgeHub chains do NOT support proxy accounts for collator registration.
#       They will still be checked for status, but actions will be flagged as
#       "manual action required" instead of being performed automatically.

# Example with multiple fallback RPCs:
# [chains.polkadot_assethub]
# rpc_urls = [
#     "wss://rpc-asset-hub-polkadot.luckyfriday.io",
#     "wss://asset-hub-polkadot-rpc.dwellir.com",
#     "wss://statemint-rpc.dotters.network"
# ]
# enabled = true

# Polkadot chains - using defaults (comment out to use built-in fallback URLs)
# [chains.polkadot_assethub]
# enabled = true

# BridgeHub - status checked but no automatic actions (no proxy support)
# [chains.polkadot_bridgehub]
# enabled = true

# [chains.polkadot_collectives]
# enabled = true

# [chains.polkadot_coretime]
# enabled = true

# [chains.polkadot_people]
# enabled = true

# Kusama chains - using defaults
# [chains.kusama_assethub]
# enabled = true

# [chains.kusama_bridgehub]
# enabled = true

# [chains.kusama_coretime]
# enabled = true

# [chains.kusama_people]
# enabled = true

# [chains.kusama_encointer]
# enabled = true
