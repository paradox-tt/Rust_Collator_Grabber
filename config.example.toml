# Collator Monitor Configuration
# ================================
# This file can be named config.toml and placed in the working directory,
# or values can be set via environment variables prefixed with COLLATOR_
# (e.g., COLLATOR_POLKADOT_COLLATOR_ADDRESS)

# Your collator account address on Polkadot-based chains (SS58 format)
polkadot_collator_address = "1YOURPOLKADOTADDRESSHERE1234567890123456789"

# Your collator account address on Kusama-based chains (SS58 format)
kusama_collator_address = "CYOURKUSAMAADDRESSHERE1234567890123456789012"

# Proxy account seed - this account signs transactions on behalf of the collator
# The proxy should be configured as NonTransfer type on-chain
# Can be a mnemonic phrase, hex seed (0x...), or derivation path (//Alice for dev)
# IMPORTANT: Keep this secret! Use environment variable COLLATOR_PROXY_SEED in production
proxy_seed = "your twelve or twenty four word mnemonic phrase goes here"

# Slack webhook URL for notifications (optional)
# If not set, notifications will be logged instead of sent to Slack
slack_webhook_url = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL"

# How often to check collator status in continuous mode (seconds)
check_interval_secs = 3600  # 1 hour

# Chain-specific configurations (optional)
# If not specified, default LuckyFriday RPC endpoints will be used
# Format: [chains."network_chain"]
#
# NOTE: BridgeHub chains do NOT support proxy accounts for collator registration.
#       They will still be checked for status, but actions will be flagged as
#       "manual action required" instead of being performed automatically.
