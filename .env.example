# Collator Monitor Environment Variables
# ========================================
# Copy this to .env and fill in your values.
# Environment variables override config.toml settings.
#
# Variable naming: 
#   COLLATOR_ prefix + field name in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
#   Single underscores are preserved in field names
#   Use double underscore (__) for nested config (e.g., chains)
#
# Examples:
#   polkadot_collator_address → COLLATOR_POLKADOT_COLLATOR_ADDRESS
#   proxy_seed               → COLLATOR_PROXY_SEED
#   chains.polkadot_assethub.rpc_url → COLLATOR_CHAINS__POLKADOT_ASSETHUB__RPC_URL

# Collator addresses (SS58 format)
# Your Polkadot collator account (used for all Polkadot system chains)
COLLATOR_POLKADOT_COLLATOR_ADDRESS=1YOURPOLKADOTADDRESSHERE1234567890123456789

# Your Kusama collator account (used for all Kusama system chains)
COLLATOR_KUSAMA_COLLATOR_ADDRESS=CYOURKUSAMAADDRESSHERE1234567890123456789012

# Proxy account seed (mnemonic or hex)
# This account signs transactions on behalf of the collator.
# It should be configured as a NonTransfer proxy on-chain.
